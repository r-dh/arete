# Decide

## Cognitive Mode

**System 2** | Goal: Select one clear path with full awareness of trade-offs

## Light Depth

When the session depth is Light, replace the steps below with a single turn: list the 2-3 options in one line each (effort, reversibility), recommend one, and state what evidence would change the call. If the user agrees, the session ends here. No Stress, no Ship, no files unless the user asks.

## Execution

### 1. Extract
Pull the distinct approaches from explore phase (typically 2-5).

### 2. Present Matrix

Display each option with these dimensions:

**Technical:**

| Option | Effort | Risk | Reversibility | NFRs (ops, scale, perf, security) |
|--------|--------|------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| A      | ...    | ...  | ...           | ...                               |
| B      | ...    | ...  | ...           | ...                               |

**Conceptual:**

| Option | Impact | Effort | Resistance | Reversibility |
|--------|--------|--------|------------|---------------|
| A      | ...    | ...    | ...        | ...           |

**Reversibility** is consistently the most undervalued axis in tech decisions. Always include it. A reversible bad decision costs far less than an irreversible one.

The **NFRs column** (technical track) is where non-functional requirements surface as trade-offs: scalability, performance, operational burden, security posture, compatibility. These feed the Spec's NFR section at SHIP. Name them as concrete pressures on the option, not abstract qualities ("ops burden: requires a new daemon to run on every host" beats "operationally complex").

Then prompt ranking:
- Technical: "Rank: Simplicity → Scalability → Cost"
- Conceptual: "Rank: Emotion → Credibility → Clarity"

### 3. Force Prioritization

**Technical trade-offs:** Consistency vs Availability | Throughput vs Latency | Simplicity vs Flexibility | Read vs Write | Guarantees vs Operational simplicity

**Conceptual trade-offs:** Inspiration vs Detail vs Fear

### 4. Challenge & Commit
Never accept without justification: "Why this over [Alternative]?" / "Truly willing to sacrifice [X]?"

**Fit to user requirements** (technical track): before committing, re-state the user requirements surfaced in Ground and confirm the chosen option can be measured against them. "User requirements were [X]. Can we observe that the chosen option delivers [X]? If yes, AC will fall out naturally in Stress. If no, the option is decoupled from the user — reconsider."

Frame the choice as a **provisional bet**, not a final commitment: "What evidence would change your mind?" This prevents both analysis paralysis and sunk-cost lock-in. The decision is real but reversible if stress-testing reveals problems.

## Response Style

4-6 lines, 50% questions. **One question per response.** Objective, analytical, skeptical. Acknowledge the user's reasoning before challenging it.

## Transition
**Coverage**: Trade-offs explicitly weighed for selected option
**Saturation**: User stops wavering; preference is stable
**Gate** (Full only): "Any trade-offs we haven't weighed?"

When criteria met → announce gate → user confirms → call `Skill(skill: "arete:stress")` to load the stress phase. Do NOT continue inline.
